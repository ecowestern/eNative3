#### Comments

Comments are used to add notes or explanations to your code. They are not executed and are for human readability.

```eNative3
# This is a single-line comment

'''
This is a
multi-line
comment
'''
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Clear Comments**: Use comments to add notes and explanations to your code, enhancing readability. eNative3's comments are essential for understanding your code's logic.
{% endhint %}

#### Variables

Variables are used to store data. You can assign different types of data to variables, such as numbers, text, or more complex structures.

```eNative3
name = "John"
age = 30
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Variable Versatility**: Explore eNative3's variable capabilities, allowing you to store and manipulate various data types effortlessly.
{% endhint %}

#### Data Types

eNative3 supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, and more.

```eNative3
x = 5          # Integer
y = 3.14       # Float
name = "John"  # String
```

### Control Structures

eNative3 provides control structures for making decisions and repeating code. Here's an example of an `if` statement:

```eNative3
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 10")
```

### Functions

You can define functions to group code into reusable blocks. Here's an example:

```eNative3
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)

greet("Alice")
```
